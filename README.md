This is a basic JavaFX project for a food ordering application.

How It Works-Users can select one or more items to eat and one type of drink. Then, press “Order” button. Once the user presses the order button, the Bill text area will display the ordered items and 
the total cost. At this point, the user has the option to cancel the order or confirm the order. If the users press the cancel button, all the selections for food and drinks will be unselected and the 
Bill text area will be cleared. If the user presses the confirm button, all the selections for Eat and Drink will be cleared, but the final bill will be displayed with order items and the final total.
